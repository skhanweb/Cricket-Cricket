						<p>Red Balls  Test match cricket is played with a red ball, achieved in the manufacture process by dying the leather in a paraffin wax. </p><p><b>White Balls -</b> White balls are used in one-day and 20-20 cricket matches. The white is 'painted' onto the balls, and therefore the ball has different properties than the traditional red balls. The white balls are much more visible than the traditional red-dyed ball against the backdrop of players' colored clothing, however they are tend to discolor and deteriorate more quickly.</p>

						<p>Most of the time, the wicket is one of the two sets of three stumps and two bails at either end of the pitch.The wicket is guarded by a batsman who, with his bat, attempts to prevent the ball from hitting the wicket.The origin of the word is from the standard definition of wicket as a small gate. Historically, cricket wickets had only two stumps and one bail and looked like a gate. The third (middle) stump was introduced in 1775.The size and shape of the wicket has changed several times during the last 300 years.</p>
