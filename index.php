  <p>Cricket</span> is a ball and sport played by 2 teams of 11 players. A match consists of 2 halves (so that each team bats and bowls) and is played on a grass field of around 15,000 m² in area. 11 "fielding/bowling team" players play against 2 "batting team" (hitting) players at any one time.
  The equipment includes a bat made of willow with a flat surface, a ball (usually red), and two wickets (made up of three vertical stumps and two small bails resting on top of the stumps). Bowlers try to hit the wicket with the ball when bowling and to break it. At the same time the batsman uses his bat to stop the ball hitting the wickets and if he hits the ball can score runs (points). While the fielding team is retrieving the ball, the batsman run backwards and forwards to score runs. If the bat						sman does not manage to reach the wicket he is running to and a fielder breaks the wicket with the ball, he is out (in this instance: run out) and the next batsman replaces him. <br/><a href="about-cricket.html">Read more >> </a> </p>

                        <p>The origin of cricket is unknown. Most probably, its name was derived from the Old English cryce, which means "stick," and, in its rude form, resembled the 13th century game known as club-ball.Cricket evolved in England in the 18th century, mainly because of the interest of great landowners who tried their skills on a field of play with their tenants and the local peasantry. Records show that teams from Kent and London played each other in 1719, and that Kent and Sussex met in 17							28.The earliest written laws (rules) date back to 1744. The Hambledon Club in Hampshire was the focal point of cricket from 1768 to about 1788. It attracted the chief patrons and best cricketers in the land and was the place where cricket took a great step forward from the rather rustic pastime that it was to the game it is today.<br/><a href="history.html">Read more>> </a> </p>

					<ul>
					<li>Throughout history most of the cricket rules suffered modifications. The only rule that did not change over time is the length of the pitch</li>
					<li>Charlie Bannerman from Australia scored the first century in Test cricket in 1877</li>
					<li>Test matches between England and Australia are known as The Ashes because of an obituary published in the Sporting Times in 1822: "In affectionate remembrance of English cricket. … The body will be cremated, and the Ashes taken to Australia."</li>
					<li>The first ever international match took place in 1844, in New York between the United States and Canada. It was won by Canada.</li>
					<li>When Australia toured England for the first time in 1868, each player wore a different colored cap, in order for the public to identify them.</li>
